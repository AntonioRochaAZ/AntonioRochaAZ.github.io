Antonio Rocha's io
==================

This is my github.io's main page, here you can find a little more about me and
links to my project's documentations. For my GitHub page, `click here <https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ>`__.

About me
========

I'm a Brazilian/Portuguese Chemical Engineer from the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro (UFRJ), having done a double degree exchange at ESPCI - Paris. I've
become interested in programming with Python and Deep Learning for engineering
applications by the beginning of 2021. Since then, I've worked on
the subject on a few different projects:

1. A project for the *Introduction to Deep Learining* class at ESPCI, developing
   a CNN for microfluidic drop recognition and classification. Code not available.

2. An internship on Battery Health estimation, using concepts of `Transfer Learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning#:~:text=Transfer%20learning%20(TL)%20is%20a,when%20trying%20to%20recognize%20trucks.>`__
   for applying models trained for one type of battery to batteries of different
   chemistries and protocols. We've recently published an open-access article on
   this work and `it can be found here <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949821X23000121>`__.
   The complete code is also available `here <https://gitlab.com/david.benhaiem/battery-soh>`__.

      *Some graphs from the* `publication <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949821X23000121>`__.

3. My undergraduate thesis on Predictive Emissions Monitoring System (PEMS) at
   the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). I developed and compared
   prediction accuracies for different types of neural networks (NNs, CNNs, RNNs)
   and hybrid models that integrate them. The final report is publicly available
   (though it is written in portuguese) and `can be found here <http://hdl.handle.net/11422/17575>`__
   Some of the results were presented in the ESCAPE32 2022 conference, the
   proceedings of `which can be found here
   <https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-95879-0.50232-0>`__. Code
   not available.

4. I did a personal project on Neural Networks for recognition of LaTeX symbols
   (`CNN Project <https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ/CNN-Project>`__). Its
   objective was to develop skills in advanced python, get used to using GitHub,
   explore CNN architectures and serve as portfolio (since other projects may
   be private). Code available below.

My Public Projects
==================

CNN Project
-----------

This is a personal project for developing skills in python and testing
different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for different tasks.
It's also supposed to serve as a bit like a portfolio, although it is still
*a work in progress*.

- `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ/CNN-Project>`__
- `Documentation <https://antoniorochaaz.github.io/CNN-Project/>`__

ProcessEngineering
------------------

Project for testing the implementation of different Process Engineering concepts.
This includes Equation Ordering Algorithms for Sequential Modeling and simulation.
It also serves as a dive into object oriented programming and dynamic definitions of functions.

- `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ/ProcessEngineering>`__
- `Documentation
  <https://antoniorochaaz.github.io/ProcessEngineering/>`__

Basic Optimization Framework
----------------------------

Small project for relearning FORTRAN 90 and studying optimization
concepts. This project is a generic framework over which simple
optimization methods can be built upon and run.

- `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ/Basic-Optimization-Framework---FORTRAN-90>`__
- All available documentation is found in the repository's
  README.md and in code comments in the beginning of functions and
  subroutines as well as throughout the code, for the interested reader.

C++ Game
========

Small project following the footsteps of `Let's make games' "How
to make a game" tutorial
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQzAHcojEKg&list=PLhfAbcv9cehhkG7ZQK0nfIGJC_C-wSLrx>`__
as a means of learning a little bit of C++.

- `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ/CPP-Game>`__
- No documentation available (yet), although I try to extensively comment what I learn along the way in this repository.
