About me
========

I'm a Double Degree Engineering Student at the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro (UFRJ) and ESPCI - Paris. I've become interested in programming with
Python and Deep Learning for engineering applications by the beginning of 2021.
Since then, I've worked on the subject on a few different projects:

1. A project for the *Introduction to Deep Learining* class, developing a CNN
   for microfluidic drop recognition and classification.
2. An internship on Battery Health estimation, using concepts of `Transfer Learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning#:~:text=Transfer%20learning%20(TL)%20is%20a,when%20trying%20to%20recognize%20trucks.>`_
   for applying models trained for one type of battery to batteries of different chemistries and protocols.
3. My undergraduate thesis on Predictive Emissions Monitoring System (PEMS), developing and comparing
   prediction accuracies for different types of neural networks (NNs, CNNs, RNNs) and hybrid models
   that integrate them.
4. Currently working on Neural Networks for recognition of LaTeX symbols (`ImageNet <https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ/ImageNet>`_).
   The objective is to develop skills in advanced python, get used to using GitHub, explore CNN architecures,
   and serve as portfolio (since other projects are private).

My Public Projects
==================

ImageNet
--------

ImageNet is a personal project for developing skills in python and testing
different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for different tasks.
It's also supposed to serve as a bit like a portfolio, although it is still
*a work in progress*.
