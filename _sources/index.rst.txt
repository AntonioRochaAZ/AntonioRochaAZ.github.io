Antonio Rocha's io
==================

This is my github.io's main page, here you can find a little more about me and
links to my project's documentations. For my GitHub page, `click here <https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ>`_.

About me
========

I'm a Double Degree Engineering Student at the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro (UFRJ) and ESPCI - Paris. I've become interested in programming with
Python and Deep Learning for engineering applications by the beginning of 2021.
Since then, I've worked on the subject on a few different projects:

1. A project for the *Introduction to Deep Learining* class, developing a CNN
   for microfluidic drop recognition and classification.
2. An internship on Battery Health estimation, using concepts of `Transfer Learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning#:~:text=Transfer%20learning%20(TL)%20is%20a,when%20trying%20to%20recognize%20trucks.>`_
   for applying models trained for one type of battery to batteries of different chemistries and protocols.
3. My undergraduate thesis on Predictive Emissions Monitoring System (PEMS), developing and comparing
   prediction accuracies for different types of neural networks (NNs, CNNs, RNNs) and hybrid models
   that integrate them.
4. Currently working on Neural Networks for recognition of LaTeX symbols (`CNN Project <https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ/CNN-Project>`_).
   The objective is to develop skills in advanced python, get used to using GitHub, explore CNN architectures,
   and serve as portfolio (since other projects are private).

My Public Projects
==================

CNN Project
-----------

This is a personal project for developing skills in python and testing
different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for different tasks.
It's also supposed to serve as a bit like a portfolio, although it is still
*a work in progress*.

- `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ/CNN-Project>`_
- `Documentation <https://antoniorochaaz.github.io/CNN-Project/>`_

ProcessEngineering
------------------

Project for testing the implementation of different Process Engineering concepts.
This includes Equation Ordering Algorithms for Sequential Modeling and simulation.
It also serves as a dive into object oriented programming and dynamic definitions of functions.

- `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ/ProcessEngineering>`_
- `Documentation
  <https://antoniorochaaz.github.io/ProcessEngineering/>`_

Basic Optimization Framework
----------------------------

Small project for relearning FORTRAN 90 and studying optimization
concepts. This project is a generic framework over which simple
optimization methods can be built upon and run.

- `GitHub Repository
<https://github.com/AntonioRochaAZ/Basic-Optimization-Framework---FORTRAN-90>`_
- All available documentation is found in the repository's
  README.md and in code comments in the beginning of functions and
  subroutines as well as throughout the code, for the interested reader.
